\section{Conclusion}  \label{sec:conclusion}

Internet security depends crucially on certificates signed by trusted CA keys. These private keys pose a single point of failure, and it is essential to limit the risk that they are compromised or abused. We have demonstrated as a proof-of-concept that secure multi-party computation can be used to enable jointly-signed certificates without ever exposing the private signing key. Our experiments indicate that a decentralized CA is feasible and affordable today. 

%MPC to sign messages is not limited to the signature generation for the CA, but can be applied to any problem to protect an all-powerful key.
